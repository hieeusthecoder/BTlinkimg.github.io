	Cooler Master's gaming peripheral brand, CM Storm, gets a new member of the family with the Quick Fire Rapid-i ($149.99), a gaming keyboard that boasts some cool features, eliminates some of the more irritating bells and whistles that come with many of the current gaming peripherals, and does it all while looking pretty good. The compact, stripped-down design of the Rapid-i may not appeal to everyone, but for some, it will be just what they're looking for. It's quite similar to the Roccat Ryos MK Pro in some respects, but its compact size and high price keep it from getting top marks.
