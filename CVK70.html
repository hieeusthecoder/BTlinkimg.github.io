		The Corsair Vengeance K70 (Cherry MX Blue) ($129.99) is offered alongside the Corsair Vengeance K70 (Cherry MX Red), with all of the same features, but offering Cherry MX Blue key switches. Because so many details are identical between the two models, this review focuses primarily upon the key switches and the differences that differentiates our review unit from its Cherry MX Red counterpart. As with the other model, the Vengeance K70 (Cherry MX Blue) may not supplant the Editors' Choice Roccat Ryos MK Pro as our top pick for gaming keyboards, but it's still one of the best around.
