	<p>Corsair is back with a Vengeance, and I couldn't be happier. The Corsair Vengeance K95 ($149.99) replaces the Corsair Vengeance K90 as the company's premier gaming keyboard, and the mechanical keyboard keeps nearly everything I loved about the original and steps it up a notch with several welcome improvements, like programmable per-key backlighting, and a black-on-black color scheme that adds a killer look to an already excellent design.</p>
