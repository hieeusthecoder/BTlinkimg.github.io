		Logitech's G910 Orion Spark ($179.99) is the the company's latest gaming keyboard, but even long-time Logitech fans might be surprised by some of the extras offered on the new model. Several customizable features let you tweak everything from lighting to programmable actions, and there are a number of other changes, with a new proprietary key-switch design, a distinctive new take on sculpted keycaps, and integration with smartphones and tablets. It's a solid keyboard for the dedicated gamer, but the casual gamer who wants something for standard computing tasks as well might want to consider another gaming keyboard, like our Editors' Choice, the Roccat Ryos MK Pro.
