		When it comes to weapons for battle, some gamers prefer features and functions, while others prize flashy designs. Generally, Mad Catz has gravitated toward the latter, but its latest keyboard may signal a change. The Mad Catz S.T.R.I.K.E. TE ($149.99) is the company's first mechanical gaming keyboard, and while it still has an eye-catching design, it brings a new level of quality to the Mad Catz lineup. Despite the improvements, however, our top pick is still the Roccat Ryos MK Pro, which has a fuller feature set and a more luxurious feel.
