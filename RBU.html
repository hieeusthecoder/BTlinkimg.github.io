		Like most tech products, are on a fairly regular cycle from one year to the next, with new models coming out every few months so that there's always something new. The newest from Razer is the BlackWidow Ultimate (2014) ($139.99), the latest iteration of the company's flagship gaming keyboard. At first glance, there's little that has changed about it—even the price is the same—but one or two essential details have gotten an overhaul, giving gamers plenty of new reasons to consider an upgrade.
