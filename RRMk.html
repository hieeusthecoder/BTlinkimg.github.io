		Roccat has been making a name for itself in the gaming peripheral market for some time, with well-made mice and keyboards that share functionality between devices and offer unique features for less. Carrying this principle forward is the Roccat Ryos MK Pro ($169.99), the flagship model for the company's new Ryos keyboard lineup. A mechanical gaming keyboard, the Ryos MK Pro is packed with dozens of customizable options, high-quality built-in features, and a solid upgrade to mechanical keyswitches with individual backlighting—a first for Roccat. The Ryos MK Pro isn't just the best keyboard Roccat has released so far, it's also our new Editors' Choice for gaming keyboards.
