		I've seen and reviewed some large keyboards, but the SteelSeries Apex£55.85 at Amazon might be one of the largest I've seen. The Apex has to be large, if only to fit in all of the dozens of keys and features offered on the keyboard. SteelSeries has loaded up the Apex with all sorts of features to delight gamers of every stripe, including unique offerings, like an extra wide space bar, additional arrow keys, and as many as 88 different macro commands with dedicated buttons. It's not quite perfect, but the SteelSeries Apex is one of the better gaming keyboards we've seen this year.
